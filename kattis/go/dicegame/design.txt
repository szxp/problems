What is the probability of a number rolled with one die?

The probability of a number equals 1 divided by the number of sides of the die.

In formal definition:
P(n) = 100 / (b1-a1+1)

What is the probability of a pair of numbers rolled with two dice?

It is the product of the probabilities of the numbers.

Formally:
P(n, m) = P(n) * P(m)

What is the probability of a sum?

It is the sum of the probabilities of those pairs of numbers that result that sum.

We need to calculate the difference between Gunnar's possibility of rolling a higher sum from a given sum and Emmas's possibility of getting a higher sum.
We are going to sum these difference adventages for each player. If Gunnar has higher probability of winning then it is Gunnar's adventage otherwise it is Emmas's.
We will do this for all possible sums.

The winner is who has higher probability difference adventage.
